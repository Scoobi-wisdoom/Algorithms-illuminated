# Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms
## week 1 - Merge sort and worst case analysis
Merge sort is a typical example of divide & conquer while it is a better version of selection, insertion, and bubble sort. Merge sort is a recursive algorithm spliting half and merge. 
#### merge sort overview
```text
        ○        <-- Level 0
      /   \
    ○       ○    <-- Level 1
   / \     / \
  ○   ○   ○   ○  <-- Level 2
 / \ / \ / \ / \
  ...
 (Further splitting continues)
  ...
●  ●  ●  ●  ●  ●  ●  ●  <-- Level m (Base case, individual elements)
```
where $` m = \log_2 n `$ which means the number of levels is $` m + 1 = \log_2 n + 1 `$

At the j level there are $` 2^j `$ subproblems of array size $` n/2^j `$.
#### pseudo code during merge
```text
i := 0
j := 0
for k = 0, ... , l
    if (C[i] <= D[j])
        A[k] = C[i]
        i++
    else
        A[k] = D[j]
        j++
```
Seeing from above, there are $` 4l + 2 \leq 6l `$ operations to merge two $` \frac{l}{2} `$ length arrays. So, the work done by a level j subproblem is $` 2^j \times \frac{6n}{2^j} = 6n `$. Summing all levels' work, $` (m + 1)6n = (\log_2 n + 1)6n = 6n\log_2 n + 6n `$

Worst case analysis mathematically tractable as opposed to analysis needing domain knowleges  (average case analysis, benchmarks). Also, constants depend on machine dependent aspects and ignoring them loses very little predictive power.

### Problem 1.3
Merge k sorted arrays (each of size n) sequentially: first two, then merge the result with the third, then the fourth, and so on. What is the total running time?

```math
2n + 3n + 4n + \dots + kn = n \sum_{i=2}^{k} i = n \left(\frac{k(k+1)}{2} - 1\right)
```

Ignoring lower-order terms and constants, the running time is approximately: $` k^2 n `$  

### Problem 1.4
Merge k sorted arrays (each of size n) by pairing them recursively until one sorted array of size kn remains. What is the total running time?

Each level of merging requires approximately $` kn `$ operations, and the number of levels is about $` \log_2 k `$. Thus, the total running time is roughly: $` kn \log_2 k `$  

### Problem 1.5
Given an unsorted array of n distinct numbers (n as a power of 2), design an algorithm to find the second-largest number using at most $` n + \log_2 n - 2 `$ comparisons. [Hint: Consider the comparisons left after finding the largest number.] 

- Is a recursive algorithm necessary?
- The largest number, by the nature of the comparison process, must have defeated the second-largest number.
#### comparison process of n numbers
```text
n/2 pairs: (○, ○), (○, ○), ... , (○, ○), (○, ○)
n/4 pairs: (○, ○), ... , (○, ○)
...
1 pair: (○, ○)
```
The number of comparisons above to get the largest number is    
```math
n - 1 
```
Additionally, throughout the proccess, a list of numbers defeated by the largest number is collected. Since the largest number competes in every level of the tournament, the size of this list is the number of levels, i.e., $` \log_2 n `$. The number of comparisons needed to find the second-largest number from this list is derived from the above as $` \log_2 n - 1 `$.

Thus, the total number of comparisons is:
```math 
n + \log_2 n - 2 
```

## week 1 - Asymptotic analysis
#### Asymptotic Notation in Seven Words
>  supress constant factors (system dependent) and lower-order terms (irrelevant for large inputs)

#### Big-O Notation
$` T(n) = O(f(n)) `$ if and only if there exist positive constants $` c `$ and $` n_0 `$ such that $` T(n) \leq c \cdot f(n) `$ for all $` n \geq n_0 `$.

Claim: If $` T(n) = a_k n^k + \cdot\cdot\cdot + a_1 n + a_0 `$ then $` T(n) = O(n^k) `$   
```math
\begin{align}
T(n) \leq |a_k|n^k + \cdot\cdot\cdot + |a_1| n^k + |a_0| n^k   \\
= (|a_k| + \cdot\cdot\cdot + |a_1| + |a_0|) n^k   \\
= c \cdot n^k
\end{align}
```

Claim: Let $` k \geq 1 `$  be a positive integer and define $` T(n) = n^k `$. Then $` T(n) `$ is not $` O(n^{k-1}) `$.   
Assume $` T(n) = O(n^{k-1}) `$. Then, there exist positive constants $` c `$ and $` n_0 `$ such that $` n^k \leq c \cdot n^{k-1} `$ for all $` n \geq n_0 `$.   

```math
\begin{align}
n^k \leq c \cdot n^{k-1} \\
\Rightarrow n \leq c 
\end{align}
```

Choosing $` n = c + 1 `$ contradicts this inequality.

#### Big-Omega Notation
$` T(n) = \Omega(f(n)) `$ if and only if there exist positive constants $` c `$ and $` n_0 `$ such that $` T(n) \geq c \cdot f(n) `$ for all $` n \geq n_0 `$.

#### Big-Theta Notation
$` T(n) = \Theta(f(n)) `$ if and only if there exist positive constants $` c_1 `$, $` c_2 `$, and $` n_0 `$ such that $` c_1 \cdot f(n) \leq T(n) \leq c_2 \cdot f(n) `$ for all $` n \geq n_0 `$.   

### Quiz 2.5
Let $` T(n) = \frac{1}{2} n^2 + 3n `$. Then, below are true.
```math
\begin{align}
T(n) = \Omega(n) \\
T(n) = \Theta(n^2) \\
T(n) = O(n^3)
\end{align}
```

Big-O notation is used mostly because alorithm designers take care more of upper bounds.   

Claim: $` 2^{n+10} = O(2^n) `$   
```math
\begin{align}
2^{n+10} = 2^{10} \cdot 2^n \\ 
\leq c \cdot 2^n
\end{align}
```
Taking $` c = 2^{10} `$ this inequality holds for all $` n \geq 1 `$, which means $` n_0 `$ could be 1.   
Claim: $` 2^{10n} `$ is not $` O(2^n) `$   
Assume $` 2^{10n} = O(2^n) `$. Then, there exist positive constants $` c `$ and $` n_0 `$ such that $` 2^{10n} \leq c \cdot 2^n `$ for all $` n \geq n_0 `$.
```math
\begin{align}
2^{10n} \leq c \cdot 2^n \\
\Rightarrow 2^{9n} \leq c
\end{align}
```
As $` n `$ goes to infinity being greater than a constant, this inequality does not hold.   
Claim: $` max(f(n), g(n)) = \Theta(f(n) + g(n)) `$ for every pair of functions from the positive integers to the nonnegative real numbers $` f(n) `$ and $` g(n) `$.   
```math
\begin{align}
max(f(n), g(n)) \leq f(n) + g(n) \\
2 \cdot max(f(n), g(n)) \geq f(n) + g(n) \\
\Rightarrow \frac{1}{2} (f(n) + g(n)) \leq max(f(n), g(n)) \leq f(n) + g(n)
\end{align}
```

### Problem 2.1
Let $` f `$ and $` g `$ be non-decreasing real-valued functions defined on the positive integers, with $` f(n) `$ and $` g(n) `$ at least 1 for all $` n \geq 1 `$. Assume that $` f(n) = O(g(n)) `$, and let $` c `$ be a positive constant. Is $` f(n) \cdot log_2 f(n)^c = O(g(n) \cdot log_2 g(n)) `$?   
Yes. By Assumption in the problem, there exist positive $` k `$ and $` n_0 `$ such that $` f(n) \leq k \cdot g(n) `$ for all $` n \geq n_0 `$. So,   
```math
\begin{align}
f(n)log_2 f(n) \leq k \cdot g(n)log_2 f(n) \\   
\leq klog_2 k \cdot g(n) + k \cdot g(n)log_2 g(n) \\   
\therefore f(n)log_2 f(n) = O(g(n)) + O(g(n)log_2 g(n))  \\
= O(g(n)log_2 g(n))
\end{align}
```

### Problem 2.2
Assume again two positive non-decreasing functions $` f `$ and $` g `$ such that $` f(n) = O(g(n)) `$. Is $` 2^{f(n)} = O(2^{g(n)}) `$?  
No.    
For this to be true, we would need to show that there exist positive constants $` c `$ and $` n_0 `$ such that: 
```math
2^{f(n)} \leq c \cdot 2^{g(n)} 
```
for all $` n \geq n_0 `$.   
By the assumption $` f(n) = O(g(n)) `$, there exist positive constants $` k `$ and $` n_0 `$ such that $` f(n) \leq k \cdot g(n) `$ for all $` n \geq n_0 `$.   
```math
2^{f(n)} \leq 2^{k \cdot g(n)}
```
Since when $` k > 1 `$, $` (2^{g(n)})^k `$ grows asymptotically *faster* than any constant multiple of $` 2^{g(n)} `$, it contradicts the Big-O requirement.

## week 2 - DIVIDE & CONQUER ALGORITHMS
#### Inversions
Let A be an array of distinct integers. The number of inversions in A is the number of pairs (i, j) of array indices such that $` i < j `$ and $` A[i] > A[j] `$.   
A left inversion is an inversion that occurs within the first half of the array, while a right inversion occurs within the second half. A split inversion is an inversion between two elements, one from the left half and one from the right half.

Since sorting is a for-free primitive of O(nlogn), mergesort is used.

#### Lemma 3.1
Let A be an array, and let C and D be the sorted versions of the first and second halves of A, respectively. An element x from the first half of A and an element y from the second half of A form a split inversion if and only if, in the Merge subroutine with inputs C and D, y is copied to the output array before x.    
Proof:   
Consider the merge step in Merge Sort, where two sorted arrays C and D are merged into a single sorted array.   
If x (from C) is copied to the output array before y (from D), then $` x \leq y `$, which means no inversion.   
If y (from D) is copied to the output array before x (from C), then $` y < x `$, which means x and y are a (split) inversion.   
```text
C (first half)  = [1, 3, 5]
D (second half) = [2, 4, 6]

C: [  ] [3] [5]  
D: [2] [4] [6]  
Output: [1] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]

C: [ ] [3] [5]  
D: [  ] [4] [6]                 -> 2 is copied to the output and C has [3, 5] whose length is the number of split inversions: 2.
Output: [1] [2] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
 
...
(Further splitting continues)

C: [ ] [ ] [ ]  
D: [ ] [ ] [6]  
Output: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [ ]
```
The Merge subroutine runs in O(n), and since there are $` O(log n) `$ levels of recursion, the overall running time is $` O(n log n) `$.

#### Strassen's Subcubic Matrix Multiplication Algorithm
According to the Master Method from a later chapter, decomposed matrix multiplication's running time is O(n^3) which is unsatisfactory since it is the same as the trivial algorithm. Strassen's algorithm reduces the number of recursive calls from 8 to 7, making its running time even lower than cubic time.   
Let X and Y be two n×n matrices, partitioned into four $` \frac{n}{2} \times \frac{n}{2} `$ submatrices:
```text
    X = [ A  B ]      Y = [ E  F ]
        [ C  D ]          [ G  H ]
then,

    X × Y = [ P1 + P4 - P5 + P7    P3 + P5           ]
            [ P2 + P4              P1 + P3 - P2 + P6 ]

Where the seven recursive multiplications are:

    P1 = (A + D) × (E + H)
    P2 = (C + D) × E
    P3 = A × (F - H)
    P4 = D × (G - E)
    P5 = (A + B) × H
    P6 = (C - A) × (E + F)
    P7 = (B - D) × (G + H)
```

#### Closest Pair
Let $` P_x `$ be the array of points sorted by the x-axis and $` P_y `$ be the array sorted by the y-axis.   
A left or right pair is the closest pair of points both of which are located in the left half or right half solely, respectively. A split pair consists of two closest points, one from the left half and the other from the right half.   
ClosestPair algorithm consist of three parts: 
1. ClosestLeftPair: Finds the closest pair in the left half.
2. ClosestRightPair: Finds the closest pair in the right half.
3. ClosestSplitPair: Determines whether the closest pair is split across both halves.   

The minimum distance between ClosestLeftPair and ClosestRightPair, denoted as $` \delta `$, is passed to ClosestSplitPair to check whether a closer split pair exists, i.e., if the distance between the split pair is less than $` \delta `$.   
- Key Idea: Perform a brute-force search over a restricted number of point pairs.

ClosestSplitPair subroutine definition:   
1. Compute $` \bar{x} `$, the largest x-coordinate from the left half of $` P_x `$, which represents the median x-coordinate of the entire array.
2. Construct $` S_y `$ from $` P_y `$ by filtering points whose **x-coordinates** lie in the interval $` (x - \delta, x + \delta) `$ 
3. Perform a brute-force search on $` S_y `$, which contains at most six points, to determine the closest pair.
4. Return the closest pair among ClosestLeftPair, ClosestRightPair, and ClosestSplitPair      

#### Lemma 3.3
In the ClosestSplitPair subroutine, suppose (p, q) is a split pair with $` d(p, q) < \delta `$ where $` \delta `$ is the smallest distance between a left pair or a right pair of points. Then:
- (a) p and q will be included in the set $` S_y `$;
- (b) at most six points of $` S_y `$ have a y-coordinate in between those of p and q.   

Proof (a):  
Since (p, q) is a split pair, one of them, say p, is from the left half and the other, say q, from the right half. Assume $` p = (x_1, y_1) `$ and $` q = (x_2, y_2) `$ and let $` \bar{x} `$ be the rightmost x-coordinate from the left half. Then, since p is from the left half and q from the right, $` x_1 \leq \bar{x} < x_2 `$. Also, by assumpiton $` d(p, q) < \delta `$,
```math
\begin{align}
\delta > \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2} \\ 
\geq max\{(x_1 - x_2)^2, (y_1 - y_2)^2\} \\   
= max\{|x_1 - x_2|, |y_1 - y_2|\} \\
\Rightarrow |x_1 - x_2|, |y_1 - y_2| < \delta
\end{align}
```
The below drawing follows from combining the fact $` x_1 \leq \bar{x} < x_2 `$ and $` |x_1 - x_2| < \delta `$   
```text
                         <----- ≤ δ ----->
--------------|---------|- -------|--------|---------|------------→ x
            x̅ - δ      x1       x̅       x2      x̅ + δ
               <---------------- 2δ --------------->
```
Recall $` S_y `$ consists of all points within $` \bar{x} - \delta \leq x ≤ \bar{x} + \delta `$. Since p and q satisfy $` x_1, x_2 \in (\bar{x} - \delta, \bar{x} + \delta) `$, they must be included in $` S_y `$.   
Proof (b):   
Assume a split pair $` p = (x_1, y_1) `$ and $` q = (x_2, y_2) `$ with $` d(p, q) < \delta `$ where $` \delta `$ is the smallest distance of a pair from the left or right half. In the process of *Proof (a)* it is shown $` |y_1 - y_2| < \delta `$. For convenience, assume q has the smallest y-coordinate in $` S_y `$. Below does drawing follow
```text
         p                  b
        +●---+----+----+----●
    δ/2 |    |    |    |a   |  
        +----+----+----●----+  
    δ/2 |    |    |  q |    |  
--------+----+----+--●-+----+--------→ x
      x̅ - δ       x̅       x̅ + δ
             ←δ/2→

```
To show a box has at most one point, we would show contradictory when proving two points being in a box. If a box has two points, the farthest distance between them is $` \sqrt{2} \cdot \delta/2 `$. This is smaller than $` \delta `$. By assumption, $` \delta `$ is the smallest possible distance between any two points when considering only pairs within the left half or within the right half. However, within a single box whose side is $` \delta/2 `$, two points can have a distance of at most $` \sqrt{2} \cdot \delta/2 `$, which is strictly less than $` \delta `$, leading to a contradiction. In conclusion, each box has at most one point, which means at most six points has a y-coordinate in between (p, q).   
#### Corollary 3.4
When the closest pair is a split pair, then the ClosestSplitPair subroutine returns it.   
Proof:   
Let (p,q) be the closest pair and a split pair. By definition, $` d(p,q) < \delta `$. By Lemma 3.3 (a), $` (p, q) \in S_y `$​, and since The ClosestSplitPair subroutine performs a brute-force search on $` S_y `$, it will consider (p, q). According to Lemma 3.3 (b), there are at most six points in $` S_y `$ with y-coordinates between those of p and q. Since (p,q) is the closest, the subroutine must return it.   

#### Theorem 3.5
For every set P of $` n \geq 2 `$ in the plane, the ClosestPair algorithm correctly computes the closest pair of P in the plane and runs in O(nlogn).   
Proof:   
It is known that preprocessing, i.e. - sorting based on x-coordinates and y-coordinates - runs in O(nlogn). Also, the recursive structure follows that of MergeSort, dividing the input in half at each step. In each recursive call, if the closest pair is a left pair, the ClosestLeftPair subroutine finds and returns it in O(n). Similarly, if the closest pair is a right pair, the ClosestRightPair subroutine does the same in O(n). Finally, if the closest pair is a split pair, Corollay 3.4 ensures that the ClosestSplitPair subroutine finds it in O(n). Since the algorithm returns the smallest distance among these three candidates, the correct closest pair is always selected. The recurrence follows the MergeSort pattern, leading to an overall time complexity of O(nlogn).    

### Problem 3.4
Given an $` n \times n `$ grid where each cell contains a distinct number, a local minimum is defined as a cell whose value is smaller than all of its adjacent neighbors (top, bottom, left, and right). Design an efficient algorithm using the divide-and-conquer approach to locate any local minimum. Your algorithm should achieve a time complexity of O(n) in terms of pairwise comparisons. 

## week 2 - Master Method
The Master Method is used to evaluate the upper bound of an algorithm. It is based on a recurrence relation. Let T(n) represent the total time for the algorithm on an input of size n. Then, the standard recurrence format is:
```math
\begin{align}
\text{Base case: T(n) is at most a constant for all sufficiently small n.} \\
\text{General case: for larger values of n,} \ T(n) \leq a \cdot T(n/b) + O(n^d) \\ 
a = \text{number of recursive calls} \\
b = \text{input size shrinkage factor} \\
d = \text{exponent in running time of the combine step} \\
\end{align}
```
The Master Method applies only if all subproblems are of equal size, and a, b, and d are constants (i.e., independent of n). In this course, Linear-time selection does not strictly follow the Master Method due to varying subproblem sizes.

#### Theorem 4.1
If T(n) is defined by a standard recurrence, with parameters $` a \geq 1, \ b > 1, \text{ and } d \geq 0 `$, then   
$` \begin{equation} T(n) = \begin{cases}O(n^d log n) ,& \text{if } a = b^d \\ O(n^d) ,& \text{if } a < b^d \\ O(n^{log_b a}) ,& \text{if } a > b^d\end{cases}\end{equation} `$   
Proof:   
By the standard recurrence form: $` T(n) \leq a \cdot T(n/b) + c \cdot n^d `$ where c is a constant, at level j there are $` a^j `$ subproblems of size $` n/b^j `$. So,
```math
\begin{align}
\text{work at level j } \leq a^j \times c \cdot [n/b^j]^d \\
= c \cdot n^d \times [a/b^d]^j \\ 
\Rightarrow \ \text{sum of work from all levels } \\ 
\leq \sum_{j=0}^{\log_b n}c \cdot n^d \times [a/b^d]^j
\end{align}   
```
This is a geometric series with ratio $` [a/b^d] `$. So, when $` a = b^d `$, $` T(n) = O(n^{d}\log_b n) `$. Also, by computing sum of a geometric series, if $` a < b^d `$ then $` T(n) = n^d `$ while if $` a > b^d `$ then $` T(n) = O(n^{\log_b a}) `$.   

Applying the Master Method to MergeSort, $` d = 1 `$ has been shown already. Likewise, $` d = 1 `$ for divide-and-conquer multiplications.

### Quiz 4.2
A binary search of a sorted array has $` a = 1, b = 2, c = 0 `$. So, the running time bound is $` O(\log n) `$.   

### Quiz 4.3
Strassen's Subcubic Matrix Multiplication differs from the naive divide-and-conquer approach in the number of recursive calls: $` a = 7 `$ vs. $` a = 8 `$. For both methods, $` b = 2 `$ because the input matrix shrinks from $` n \times n `$ to $` \frac{n}{2} \times \frac{n}{2} `$. Although the number of entries decreases from $` n^2 `$ to $` \frac{n^2}{4} `$, the recurrence is written as T(n), not $` T(n^2) `$, so $` b \neq 4 `$. The additional matrix operations outside of recursion take $` O(n^2) `$ time, meaning $` d = 2 `$. This is because computing each submatrix of the result involves additions of $` \frac{n}{2} \times \frac{n}{2} `$ matrices, and each matrix has $` \frac{n^2}{4} `$ entries.   

The recurrence $` T(n) \leq 2 \cdot T(\frac{n}{2})  + O(n^2) `$ has a counterintuitive result: $` T(n) = O(n^2) `$. At first glance, it might be mistakenly expected to be $` T(n) = O(n^{2} \log n) `$ by analogy with MergeSort's recurrence $` T(n) \leq 2 \cdot T(\frac{n}{2}) + O(n) `$, which gives $` T(n) = O(n\log n) `$.

### Problem 4.5
Suppose the running time T(n) of an algorithm is bounded by recurrence with T(n) = 1 and $` T(n) \leq T(\lfloor n^{1/2} \rfloor) + 1 `$ for $` n > 1 `$. Show  $` O(\log\log n) `$ is an upper bound of $` T(n) `$, i.e. $` T(n) = O(\log\log n) `$.   
Solution:   
Notice that T(n) is not defined by a standard recurrence form. Since the number of subroutines is 1 and the combine step takes constant running time, $` \text{work at level j } \leq  \text{number of subproblems } \times \text{work per subproblem } = 1 \times 1`$
```math
\begin{align}
n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{<-- Level 0} \\
| \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \\ 
n^{\frac{1}{2}} \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{<-- Level 1} \\
| \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \\ 
n^{\frac{1}{4}} \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{<-- Level 2} \\

... \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \\ 
| \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \\ 
1 \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{<-- Level m} \\
\end{align}
```
m should be found such that $` \lim\limits_{n\to \infty} n^{(\frac{1}{2})^m}  = 1`$. Taking log on both sides of the equality, we have $` \lim\limits_{n\to \infty} (\frac{1}{2})^m \log n = 0 `$. This means that $` (\frac{1}{2})^m `$ decreases much faster than how $` \log n `$ grows. So, 
```math
\begin{align}
(\frac{1}{2})^m = O(\frac{1}{\log n}) \\
\Rightarrow \ m \log \frac{1}{2} = O(\log \frac{1}{\log n}) \\
\Rightarrow \ -m \log 2 = O(-\log \log n) \\
\Rightarrow \ m = O(\frac{1}{\log 2} \cdot \log \log n) \\ 
\therefore \ m = O(\log \log n) \\ 
\end{align}
```
Since $` \sum_{j=0}^{m}1 = O(\log\log n)`$, $` T(n) = O(\log\log n) `$.   

## week 3 - QuickSort
#### quick sort overview
QuickSort is an in-place sorting algorithm, unlike MergeSort, which requires additional space. This makes QuickSort preferable for many programming libraries as their default sorting algorithm. Key idea of QuickSort is:
- Pivot
  - Partition
- Swap

QuickSort picks a pivot and rearranges other elements to the left and right of the pivot (partition), according to comparison between an element and the pivot (the one smaller than the pivot goes to the left and bigger to the right). During partition, sorting does not happen on the subproblems. It is only the pivot which goes to the rightful place. The partition step runs in O(n) time, and unlike MergeSort, QuickSort does not have an explicit combine step, and split the problem into left and right subproblems around the pivot.   
Proof: Correctness   
To prove this by mathematical induction, let P(n) denote for every input array of length n, QuickSort algorithm sorts the input array in order. For n = 1, the array is trivially sorted. Assume for n = k, QuickSort correctly sorts any input array of size k. Now, P(k+1) needs to be shown. For n = k+1, QuickSort selects a pivot and partitions the array into two subarrays:
```text
An input of length k+1
┌───────────────────────────┬─────┌───────────────────────────┐
│             pivot >       │pivot│      > pivot              │
└───────────────────────────┴─────└───────────────────────────┘
<---- at most k length ---->      <---- at most k length ---->
```
By the assumption, the left and right partitions (each of at most k elements) are correctly sorted. Since the pivot is placed in its rightful position, the entire array of length k+1 is sorted. Hence, P(k+1) holds.   

#### QuickSort
QuickSort algorithm takes three inputs:
- A: an input array of n length
- l: left endpoint (for initial execution, l = 0)
- r: right endpoint   

Also here, the choice of a pivot and the partition subroutine remain abstract.
```text
Given
         ┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
array A  │     │ ... │     │     │     │ ... │     │     │
         └─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
index:      0          l-1    l                       r

Choose a pivot p, and swap it with the left endpoint.
         ┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
         │     │ ... │     │  p  │ ... │     │     │     │
         └─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
            0          l-1    l                       r

Execute partition on the subarray from index l to r.
         ┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
         │     │ ... │     │  p  │ ... │     │     │     │
         └─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
            0          l-1    l                       r
                            <----- partition target ---->

Recursively call QuickSort excluding the pivot.
               ┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
               │     │ ... │     │  p  │     │ ... │     │
               └─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
                <-- QuickSort -->       <-- QuickSort -->
```

#### Partition
The partition subroutine returns an index of the pivot after placing the pivot at a rightful location. 
At the start of the partition subroutine, the pivot is placed at the beginning of the array. This specifically applies to the first call to Partition, where the pivot is initially placed at index 0.
```text
Initialization
                     ┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
partition target     │  p  │     │ ... │     │     │     │     │
                     └─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
index:                       i,j

All done before swap and return step
                     ┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
                     │  p  │ ... │     │  k  │     │ ... │     │
                     └─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
                                                i           j
                            <----  p >  ----> <----  p <  ---->

Swap the pivot with the right most element smaller than the pivot.
                     ┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
                     │  k  │ ... │     │  p  │     │ ... │     │
                     └─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
                                                i
                      <----  p >  ---->       <----  p <  ---->
```
After the processes are finished in the figure above, the partition subroutine returns a rightful location of the pivot.   

It is a choice of pivot which determines efficiency of the QuickSort algorithm. If an input array is already sorted and also if the pivot is always the first element, then QuickSort algorithms run in $` O(n^2) `$. To be away from this situation, choice of a pivot is randomized.   

Master Method does not apply to QuickSort because pivot is randomly chosen and subproblems are of different sizes.   

#### Theorem 5.1
For every input array of length $` n \geq 1 `$, the average running time of randomized QuickSort is $` O(n \log n) `$.   
Proof:   
This is implied by Lemma 5.2 and Theorem 5.3.

#### Lemma 5.2
There is a constant $` a > 0 `$ such that for every input array A of length at least 2 and every pivot sequence $` \omega `$, $` RT(\omega) \leq a \cdot C(\omega) `$.   
- RT: running time of QuickSort.
- C: total number of comparisons made by QuickSort.   

Proof:   
Each QuickSort call consists of a partition step followed by two recursive calls. The partition step involves comparing each element to the pivot, performing a constant amount of extra work per comparison, such as swapping elements. Thus, the total work done in a partition step is at most a constant multiple of the number of comparisons made. Summing over all partitions,
```math
RT(\omega) = \sum_{\text{all partitions}} (\text{constant} \cdot \text{number of comparisons in that partition} + \text{constant}).
```
Since the total number of comparisons across all partitions is precisely $` C(\omega) `$, for some constants $` a' `$ and $` b' `$ this equations is expressed as:
```math
\begin{align}
RT(\omega) = a' \cdot C(\omega) + b' \\
\Rightarrow  RT(\omega) \leq a \cdot C(\omega)
\end{align}
```
by choosing sufficiently large $` a `$.   

This means that the possible number of comparisons between two arbitrarily chosen elements matter to determine the running time of QuickSort.

#### Theorem 5.3
For every input array of length $` n \geq 1 `$, the expected number of comparisons between input array elements in randomized QuickSort is at most $` 2 \cdot (n-1)\ln n = O(n\log n) `$.   
Proof:   
Let $` z_i `$ and $` z_j `$ denote the ith and jth smallest elements of the input array. Define $` X_{ij}(\omega) `$ as the number of comparisons between $` z_i `$ and $` z_j `$ in QuickSort when the pivots are specifed by $` \omega `$ for every fixed choice of pivots $` \omega `$. The total number of comparisons made by QuickSort is expressed as:
```math
\begin{align}
C(\omega) = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}(\omega) \\
\Rightarrow E(C) = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E(X_{ij}) \\
= \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr(X_{ij}=1). \\
= \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} \ \ \ \ \ \text{ by Lemma 5.4.}
\end{align}
```
This is bounded:
```math
\begin{align}
\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} \leq \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} 2 \cdot (\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \cdot \cdot \cdot + \frac{1}{n}) \\
= 2 \cdot (n-1)\sum_{j=2}^{n}\frac{1}{j} \\
\leq 2 \cdot (n-1) \int_{1}^{n} \frac{1}{x} \,dx \\
= 2 \cdot (n-1) \ln n = O(n \log n)
\end{align}
```

#### Lemma 5.4
If $` z_i `$ and $` z_j `$ denote the ith and jth smallest elements of the input array, with $` i < j `$, then, $` \Pr [z_i,z_j \text{ get compared in randomized QuickSort}] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1} `$    
Proof:   
Considering the fact that QuickSort's recursive calls on the left and right of the pivot, the pivot should not be between $` z_i `$ and $` z_j `$ for $` z_i `$ and $` z_j `$ to be compared eventually. Therefore,
```math
\begin{align}
\Pr [z_i,z_j \text{ get compared at some point in randomized QuickSort}] \\
= \Pr [z_i \text{ or } z_j \text{ is chosen as a pivot before any of } z_{i+1}, ..., z_{j-1}] \\
= \frac{2}{j - i + 1} \\
\end{align}
```
because randomized QuickSort chooses a pivot at uniformly random.      

#### Theorem 5.5
There is a constant $` c > 0 `$ such that, for every $` n \geq 1 `$, every comparison-based sorting algorithm performs at least $` c \cdot n \log_2 n `$ operations on some length-n input array.   
- A comparison-based sorting algorithm orders elements using only pairwise comparisons, without accessing or manipulating values directly. Examples of non-comparison-based sorting algorithms are: BucketSort, CountingSort, and RadixSort.    

Proof:   
Assume a comparison-based sorting algorithm which does at most k comparisons. Through this algorithm, there are $` 2^k `$ number of possible execution paths such as below:
```text
             Compare A[1], A[2]
            /                   \
    A[1] < A[2]               A[1] > A[2]
       /       \                 /       \
A[2] < A[3]   A[2] > A[3]   A[1] < A[3]  A[1] > A[3]
      ...         ...          ...          ...
```
This algorithm can distinguish between at most different $` 2^k `$ inputs and execute in at most $` 2^k `$ different ways. An input array of length n could be arranged in $` n! `$ ways. So, to differentiate all possible arrangements, k should satisfy $` 2^k \geq n! `$. By the fact that the first n/2 elements of $` n! `$ is greater than $` n/2 `$:
```math
\begin{align}
2^k \geq n! \geq (\frac{n}{2})^{n/2} \\
\Rightarrow k \geq n/2 \cdot(\log_2 n - 1) \\
= \Omega(n \log n)
\end{align}
```

### Problem 5.1
Choose elements which could have been the pivot element.
```text
┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
│  3  │  1  │  2  │  4  │  5  │  8  │  7  │  6  │  9  │
└─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
```
Not 7. After partition is over all elements on the left of the pivot are smaller than the pivot.   

### Problem 5.5
Extend the $` \Omega(n \log n) `$ lower bound from Theorem 5.5 to apply also to the expected running time of randomized comparison-based sorting algorithms.   
The running time of a sorting algorithm depends on the number of comparison operations. Even with randomness, the number of comparisons needed to distinguish between different input arrays remains the same. This is because, regardless of random choices, the number of comparison operations must be sufficient to distinguish between all $` n! `$ possible permutations of the array.

## week 4 - Linear-Time Selection
- RSelect: randomized selection. O(n)   
- DSelect: deterministic selection. O(n)  

While both run in O(n) time, RSelect is typically faster in practice because DSelect has a larger constant factor. Additionally, DSelect requires more memory than RSelect since execution of DSelect is not in-place.   

After sorting an input array, it is easy to get ith smallest value, but this is not linear time but $` O(n\log n) `$.
#### RSelect overview
- Choose a pivot randomly.
- Execute partition process of QuickSort.
- Choose one and only one subarray to recurse on depending on comparison between the pivot location and i.
```text
Choice of a recursion:       i ∈ [left part]         i ∈ [right part]      
                            ─────────────────       ─────────────────    
                           ┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
                           │     │ ... │     │  p  │     │ ... │     │
                           └─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
index:                                          k
                            <----  p >  ---->       <----  p <  ---->
```
The running time of RSelect depends on how good a chosen pivot is.   

#### Theorem 6.1
For every input array of length $` n \geq 1 `$, the average running time of RSelect is O(n). 

Proof:   
Since there is only one recursive call to RSelect, to track the size of the subarray on a recursive call phase j is used. 
- Phase j: progress of a recursive call to RSelect in relation with the length of its subarray. 
  - If the length of its subarray is between $` n \cdot (\frac{3}{4})^{j+1} `$ and $` n \cdot (\frac{3}{4})^j `$, the recursive call is in phase j.    
- $` X_j `$: number of phase-j recursive calls   

Because RSelect's running time is O(n) outside of its recursive call (partition), there is a constant $` c > 0 `$ such that for every input array of length n, RSelect performs at most cn operations outside of its recursive call. So, in each phase-j recursive call RSelect performs at most $` c \cdot (\frac{3}{4})^j \cdot n `$ operations. So the total running time is:
```math
\begin{align}
\text{running time of RSelect} \leq \sum_{j \geq 0} X_j \cdot c \cdot  (\frac{3}{4})^j \cdot n \\
= cn \sum_{j \geq 0} (\frac{3}{4})^j \cdot X_j \\
\Rightarrow E[\text{running time of RSelect}] \leq cn \sum_{j \geq 0} (\frac{3}{4})^j \cdot E[X_j] \\
\end{align}
```

By corollary 6.5, 
```math
\begin{align}
E[\text{running time of RSelect}] = cn \sum_{j \geq 0}(\frac{3}{4})^jE[X_j] \leq 2cn\sum_{j \leq 0}(\frac{3}{4})^j \\
= 8cn \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \\
\therefore E[\text{running time of RSelect}] = O(n) \\
\end{align}
```

#### Proposition 6.2
If a phase-j recursive call chooses an approximate median, then the next recursive call belongs to phase j+1 or later.   
Proof:   
- Approximate median: an element greater than at least 25% of the other elements in the subarray and less than at least 25% of the other elements   

By definition of an approximate median, given that an approximate median has been chosen, the subarray of the next recursive call is sized at most 75%, i.e. $` \frac{3}{4} `$
```text
     25%                           25%
 ───────────                   ───────────    
┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
│     │ ... │     │     │     │ ... │     │
└─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
             ─────────────────
       possible approximate medians
```
#### Proposition 6.3
A call to RSelect chooses an approximate median with probability at least 50%.   
Proof:   
This follows directrly from the uniform randomness of the pivot choice, and also by the definition of an approximate median.   

#### Proposition 6.4
For each phase j, $` E[X_j] \leq E[N] `$.   
- N: number of tries of tossing a coin till it is heads   
  - Rather than dealing with the complexities of $` X_j `$​ , we compare it to N, which follows a straightforward coin-flipping process.

Proof:   
It is to be shown
```math
\begin{align}
E[X_j] = E[X_j | O_j] \cdot Pr(O_j) + E[X_j | O_j^\complement] \cdot Pr(O_j^\complement) \\
\leq E[N] \\
\end{align}
```
where $` O_j `$ denotes the event that phase j actually occurs. $` O_j^\complement `$ happens if the chosen median reduces the subarray size more than 25% (for example, getting the exact median).    
Here, $` E[X_j | O_j^\complement] \cdot Pr(O_j^\complement) = 0 `$ because:   
```math
\begin{align}
E[X_j | O_j^\complement] = \sum_{x \geq 0} x \cdot Pr(X_j = x | O_j^\complement) \\
= 0 \cdot Pr(X_j = 0 | O_j^\complement) + \sum_{x > 0} x \cdot Pr(X_j = x | O_j^\complement) \\
= 0 \cdot 1 + \sum_{x > 0} x \cdot 0 \ \ \ \because Pr(X_j = 0 | O_j^\complement) = 1 \text{ by definition of } O_j \\ 
\therefore E[X_j | O_j^\complement] = 0.
\end{align}
```
So, $` E[X_j] = E[X_j | O_j] \cdot Pr(O_j) `$.    

Now, by showing $` E[X_j | O_j] \cdot Pr(O_j) \leq E[N] `$ the proof is done. By the fact that there is only single recursive call, if any, to RSelect in each phase: 
```math
\begin{align}
E[X_j | O_j] = \sum_{j \geq 0} 1 \cdot Pr(X_j = 1 | O_j) \cdot Pr(O_j) \\
= \sum_{j \geq 0} Pr(O_j) \ \ \ \because Pr(X_j = 1 | O_j) = 1
\end{align}
```
Also, $` E[N] = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} n \cdot Pr(N = n) `$. Putting altogether, the inequality is expressed as:
```math
\begin{align}
E[X_j | O_j] \leq E[N] \\
\Rightarrow \sum_{j \geq 0} Pr(O_j) \leq \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} n \cdot Pr(N = n) \\
= \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} n \cdot (\frac{1}{2})^n \\
\end{align}
```
By proposition 6.2 and 6.3, $` Pr(O_j) `$ reduces at least of a factor of 50% whereas the right-hand side's is exactly 50%. So the inequality holds.   

#### Corollary 6.5
For every j, $` E[X_j] \leq 2 `$.   
Proof:   
This follows by the fact that $` E[N] = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} n \cdot (\frac{1}{2})^n = 2 `$ and proposition 6.4. $` \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} n \cdot (\frac{1}{2})^n = 2 `$ because
```math
\begin{align}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n = \frac{1}{1-x} \text{ , for } |x| < 1 \\ 
\Rightarrow \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} n \cdot x^{n-1} = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \\
\Rightarrow \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n \cdot x^n = \frac{x}{(1-x)^2} \\
\text{By applying } x = \frac{1}{2}, \\ 
\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} n \cdot (\frac{1}{2})^n = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{(1 -\frac{1}{2})^2} = 2 \\
\therefore E[N] = 2 \\
\end{align}
```

#### DSelect pseudo code
- Input: array A of $` n \geq 1 `$ distinct numbers, and an integer $` i \in \{1, 2, ..., n\} `$.
- Output: the ith order statistic of A.
```text
 1  if n = 1 then
 2      return A[1]
 3  for h := 1 to n/5 do
 4      C[h] := middle element from the hth group of 5
 5  p := DSelect(C, n/10)
 6  partition A around p
 7  j := p's position in partitioned array
 8  if j = i then
 9      return p
10  else if j > i then
11      return DSelect(first part of A, i)
12  else
13      return DSelect(second part of A, i - j)
```
This algorithm is identical to RSelect except lines 3 to 5, where the pivot is chosen deterministically using the median-of-medians method rather than randomly.

### Quiz 6.3
A single call to DSelect has 2 recursive calls not 1. The first occurs when finding the median-of-medians while the second happens after partitioning.      

#### Theorem 6.6
For every input array of length $` n \geq 1 `$, the running time of DSelect is O(n).   
Proof:   
DSelect is expressed in a recurrence format of: 
```math
T(n) \leq T(\frac{1}{5}n) + T(\frac{7}{10}n) + O(n).
```
- $` T(\frac{1}{5}n) `$: operations in line 5 in the pseudo code
- $` T(\frac{7}{10}n) `$: operations in line eiter 11 or 13 by lemma 6.7
- O(n): running time bound of sorting each of $` \frac{n}{5} `$ arrays with length 5, more exactly $` \Theta(n) `$.   

$` T(n) \leq l \cdot n `$ to be shown for some constant $` l > 0 `$ through mathematical induction. Choose $` l = 10c `$. For the base case, T(1) = 1. This holds for $` c \geq 1 `$, $` T(1) \leq l`$. Assume $` T(k) \leq l \cdot k `$ for $` k < n `$. So,
```math
\begin{align}
T(n) \leq T(\frac{1}{5}n) + T(\frac{7}{10}n) + cn \\
\leq l \cdot \frac{1}{5}n + l \cdot \frac{7}{10}n + cn \\
= (\frac{9}{10}l + c)n = 10cn \\
\therefore T(n) \leq l \cdot n \\
\end{align}
```
Thus, T(n) = O(n).

#### Lemma 6.7
For every input array of length $` n \geq 2 `$, the subarray passed to the recursive call in line 11 or 13 of DSelect has length at most $` \frac{7}{10}n `$.   
Proof:   
Let $` k = \frac{n}{5} `$ denote the number of groups of size 5. Also let x_i denote the median of each group where $` i \in \{1, 2, ..., \frac{n}{5}\} `$. Then, the median-of-medians is x_k/2 if k is even; otherwise, it is ⌈k/2⌉. By the drawing below, the median-of-medians is greater than at least 30% of elements in the input array.
```text
              | Group 1 |   ...   |Group k/2|   ...   | Group k |
              |---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
              | greater |   ...   | greater |   ...   | greater |
              | greater |   ...   | greater |   ...   | greater |
          ┌─  |   x_1   |   ...   |  x_k/2  |   ...   |  x_n/5  |
3/5 rows  │   | smaller |   ...   | smaller |   ...   | smaller |
          │   | smaller |   ...   | smaller |   ...   | smaller |
          │
          └─────────────────────────────────┘
                         1/2 columns
3/5 * 1/2 = 30%
```
Similarly, the median-of medians is less than at least 30% of elements in the input array. So, the median-of-medians, i.e. the pivot, lies between a range of excluding left and right 30% of the array such as below:
```text
  30% of n                       30% of n
 ───────────                   ───────────
┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
│     │ ... │     │     │     │ ... │     │
└─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
             <- pivot range ->
```
Thus, the subarray passed to the recursive call in line 11 or 13 is guaranteed to have at most $` \frac{7}{10}n `$.

### Problem 6.3
Suppose an unsorted input array of length n consisting of distinct elements $` x_i `$ for $` i \in \{1,2,..., n\} `$. Each element $` x_i `$ has a positive weight $` w_i `$, and let $` W = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} w_i `$. Using DSelect, find an element $` x_k `$ such that  $` \sum_{x_i < x_k} w_i \leq \frac{W}{2} `$ and also $` \sum_{x_i > x_k} w_i  \leq \frac{W}{2} `$. Observe that there is either one or two such elements.   
- Input
  - A: the input array of length n
  - W: $` \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i `$
  - D_L: total discarded weights of elements that are less than the elements of the subarray; initialized as 0
  - D_R: total discarded weights of elements that are greater than the elements of the subarray; initialized as 0
```text
 1  function WeightedMedian(A, W, D_L, D_R)
 2      if n = 1 then
 3          return A[0]
 4      p := DSelect(A, n/2)  // Compute unweighted median
 5      Partition A around p
 6      Compute W_L and W_R, the total weight of elements on each side of p
 7      if W_L + D_L ≤ W/2 and W_R + D_R ≤ W/2 then
 8          return p
 9      else if W_L + D_L > W/2 then
10          return WeightedMedian(left part of A, W, D_L, D_R + W_R + weight of p)
11      else         // Since the total weight is W, both sides cannot each have weight > W/2.
12          return WeightedMedian(right part of A, W, D_L + W_L + weight of p, D_R)
```
This algorithm is represented by a recurrence format:
```math
\begin{align}
T(n) \leq T(\frac{n}{2}) + O(n) \\
\therefore T(n) = O(n) \ \text{ by Master Method.}
\end{align}
```

## week 4 - Graphs and the Contraction Algorithm
A graph means pairs of objects. A graph consists of vertices (V), aka. nodes, and edges (E), aka. arcs or pairs of vertices.    

Unlike an array input, which has a length, a graph's size needs more attention to be defined. This is a function of two parameters: the number of vertices and the number of edges. In notation expression, for a graph G = (V, E) with vertex set V and edge set E, 
- n = |V|: the number of vertices
- m = |E|: the number of edges.   

In an undirected graph, m depends on n denoted as $` m = \Omega(n) `$ since there are at least n-1 number of edges. Also, $` m = O(n^2) `$ since there are at most $` \frac{n(n-1)}{2} `$ number of edges with an assumption of no parallel edge, which means there is at most one undirected edge between each pair of vertices.
```text
Sparse (few edges)    Ω(n) <-----------------> O(n²)    Dense (many edges)
```
#### adjacency list
The adjacency list consists of:
1. an array containing the graph's vertices
2. an array containing the graph's edges
3. for each edge, a pointer to each of its two endpoints
4. for each vertex, a pointer to each of the incident edges.

In a graph, an edge is said to be incident to a vertex if the vertex is one of the endpoints of the edge. For example, in an undirected graph:
```text
A --- B --- C
```
The edge (A, B) is incident to both A and B.

### Quiz 7.2
How much space does the adjacency list representation of a graph require, as a function of the number n of vertices and the number m of edges?   
It is trivial to say that the first and the second ingredients' are O(n) and O(m), respectively. Since the third ingredient is a pointer for two enpoints, it is 2m = O(m). Since the fourth and the third one are in one-to-one correspondence, the fourth is also O(m). So,
```math
O(n) + O(m) + O(m) + O(m) = O(n + m).
```

#### adjacency matrix
The adjacency matrix representation of a graph G = (V, E) with n vertices consists of elements $` A_{ij} `$ such that $` \begin{equation} A_{ij} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if edge (i, j) belongs to E} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise } \end{cases}\end{equation} `$.   

Since the adjacency matrix's memory space is $` O(n^2) `$, if the given graph is sparse, the adjacency list is preferred over the matrix. Also, choosing adjacency list over the matrix takes less time when to figure out which edges are incident to a given vertex.   

### Problem 7.1
Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph. By the degree of a vertex $` v \in V `$, we mean the number of edges in E that are incident to v (i.e., that have v as an endpoint). For each of the following conditions on the graph G, is the condition satisfied only by dense graphs, only by sparse graphs, or by both some sparse and some dense graphs? As usual, n = |V| denotes the number of vertices. Assume that n is large (say, at least 10,000).   
(a) At least one vertex of G has degree at most 10.   
It is trivial that all sparse graphs are this case. Also, a dense graph in which all vertices have n-1 edges except one vertex having just one edge satisties this condition.
(c) At least one vertex of G has degree n - 1.
It is trivial that all dens graphs are this case. Also, a sparse graph in which there is a center vertex connected to n - 1 vertices satisties this condition.   

### Problem 7.3
Suppose a directed graph G = (V,E) represented with adjacency lists, with each vertex storing an array of its outgoing edges (but not its incoming edges). Given a vertex $` v \in V `$, how many operations are required to identify the incoming edges of v?   
By the operation in detail is checking all outgoing edges whose endpoint is v. So the number of edges, i.e. m, is to be parsed one by one. Thus it is $` \Theta(m) `$.

# Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures
## week 1 - Breadth-first and depth-first search; computing strong components; applications.
Graph Search Abstraction:   
1. Goals
  - Given a directed or undirected graph G = (V, E) and a starting vertex $` s \in V `$, identify all vertices reachable from s in G without permforming redundant work.
  - A vertex $` v \in V `$ is said to be reachable from $` s `$ if there exists a path (i.e., a sequence of edges) from $` s `$ to $` v `$.
2. Primitives: Operations such as visiting all vertices and edges can be done in O(n + m), where $` n=∣V∣ `$ and $` m=∣E∣ `$.
3. Generic Algorithm (given graph G, vertex s)
- mark s as explored; all the other vertices are unexplored.
- while possible:
  - **choose an edge (v, w)** such that $` v `$ is explored and $` w `$ is unexplored. The strategy for choosing the edge $` (v, w) `$ distinguishes different search algorithms.
  - mark w explored.

#### Proposition 8.1
At the conclusion of GenericSearch algorithm, a vertex $` v \in V `$ is marked as explored if and only if there is a path from $` s `$ to $` v `$ in G.   
Proof:   
(⇒) if there is a path from $` s `$ to $` v `$, then $` v `$ is marked as explored.   
Suppose there is a path from $` s `$ to $` v: s = v_0 → v_1 → \cdot\cdot\cdot → v_n`$, where $` (v_{i}, v_{i+1}) \in E `$ for $` i = 0, ..., n-1 `$. We show by induction that all vertices $` v_i `$ are marked as explored.
- Base case: For $` i = 0, v_0 = s `$ is marked as explored by GenericSearch algorithm's initialization.
- Inductive step: Assume $` v_k `$ is marked as explored for some $` k < n `$. Since $` (v_k, v_{k+1}) \in E `$, the GenericSeacrh algorighm marks $` v_{k+1} `$ as marked.

(⇐) if $` v `$ is marked as explored, then there is a path from $` s `$ to $` v `$.   
We prove by contradiction. Suppose $` v `$ is unexplored at the end of the algorithm but there exists a path from $` s `$ to $` v: s = v_0 → v_1 → \cdot\cdot\cdot → v_n`$, where $` (v_{i}, v_{i+1}) \in E `$. This means that there exists an edge $` (v_{k-1}, v_k) `$ for $` k \geq 1 `$ with $` v_{k-1} `$ explored and $` v_k `$ unexplored. By the definition of the algorithm, howver, this is impossible.  

### Quiz 8.1
Consider an undirected graph with $` n \geq 2 `$ vertices. What are the minimum and maximum number of different layers that the graph could have respectively?   
2 and n.   

Breadth-First Search (BFS) explores nodes in "layers" and runs in O(m + n) time using a queue (FIFO). Marking always occurs together with enqueuing. One important detail to remember is that all neighbors of the current vertex should be enqueued during the same iteration of the loop; otherwise, they will not be visited in the correct order, and may be skipped altogether.   

#### Theorem 8.2
For every undirected or directed graph G = (V, E) in adjacency-list representation and for every starting vertex $` s \in V `$:   
(a) At the conclusion of BFS, a vertex $` v \in V `$ is marked as explored if and only if there is a path from $` s `$ to $` v `$ in G.   
(b) The running time of BFS is O(m + n), where m = |E| and n = |V|.   
(c) The running time of BFS's main while loop is $` O(m_s + n_s) `$, where $` m_s `$ and $` n_s `$ denote the number of edges and vertices, respectively, reachable from s in G.   
Proof:   
(a) and (b) follow from Preposition 8.1 and proof of (c), respectively. For part (c), observe that the BFS loop iterates over only those vertices and edges reachable from $` s `$. Each vertice is added to the queue and explored exactly once by GenericSearch algorithm, contributing $` O(n_s) `$ to the total running time. For each explored vertex, BFS iterates over its outgoing edges. Since edges reachable from the given vertex is processed at most twice (at most once in a directed graph), this contributes $` O(m_s) `$ time. Therefore, the total running time of the BFS loop is $` O(m_s + n_s) `$.  

#### Theorem 8.3
For every undirected or directed graph G = (V, E) in adjacency-list representation and for every starting vertex $` s \in V `$:   
(a) At the conclusion of Augmented-BFS, for every vertex $` v \in V `$, the value of $` l(v) `$ equals the length $` dist(s, v) `$ of a shortest path from $` s `$ to $` v `$ in G (or $` +\infty `$, if no such path exists).   
(b) The running time of Augmented-BFS is O(m + n), m = |E| and n = |V|.   
Proof:   
Two obervations proves part (a). First, with dist(s, v) = i, the vertex v is precisely in the i-th layer of the graph. Second, Augmented-BFS eventually sets $` l(w) = i `$ for every vertex in the i-th layer.   
Part (b) follows from Theorem 8.2.   

### Quiz 8.2
Consider an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges. What are the minimum and maximum number of connected components that the graph could have, respectively?   
1 and n.   

An undirected connected component (UCC) is a maximal subset $` S ⊆ V `$ of vertices such that there is path from any vertex in S to any other vertex in S.   

#### Theorem 8.4
For every undirected graph G = (V, E) in adjacency-list representation:   
(a) At the conclusion of UCC, for every pair of vertices $` u, v `$, $` cc(u) = cc(v) `$ if and only if $` u `$ and $` v `$ belong to the same connected component of G.   
(b) The running time of UCC is O(m + n), where m = |E| and n = |V|.   
Proof:   
(a)   
- (⇒) Suppose $` cc(u) = cc(v) `$. Then both vertices were marked during the same BFS traversal starting from some vertex $` s `$, meaning both are reachable from $` s `$, and hence from each other. So they belong to the same connected component.   
- (⇐) Suppose $` u `$ and $` v `$ belong to the same connected component. Then there is a path between them. Since the BFS explores all vertices reachable from a starting vertex, they will be marked during the same BFS call and assigned the same component label.   
Part (b) follows from Theorem 8.2(c).

UCC is not only solved by BFS but also by DFS.

Unlike BFS, where all elements in the queue are already marked as explored when enqueued, DFS works with a stack that may contain both explored and unexplored nodes. DFS can be implemented either iteratively or recursively. Interestingly, these two approaches result in opposite exploration orders. Why? Suppose a vertex $` s \in V `$ has $` k `$ unexplored neighbors: $` (s, v_1), (s, v_2), ..., (s, v_k) `$. In iterative DFS, these neighbors are pushed onto the stack in the order $` v_1, v_2, ..., v_k `$, so they will be popped and processed in reverse order: $` v_k, v_{k-1}, ..., v_1 `$. In recursive DFS, the neighbors are explored via recursive calls in the original order: $` v_1 `$ first, then $` v_2 `$, and so on.   

#### Theorem 8.5
For every undirected or directed graph G = (V, E) in adjacency-list representation and for every starting vertex $` s \in V `$ :   
(a) At the conclusion of DFS, a vertex $` v \in V `$ is marked as explored if and only if there is a path from $` s `$ to $` v `$ in G.   
(b) The running time of DFS is O(m + n), where m = |E| and n = |V|.   
Proof:   
Part (a) follows from GenericSearch. For part (b), by the fact that DFS examines each edge at most twice and also by the fact that a stack supports push/pop in a constant time, i.e. O(1), O(m) is calculated. The initialization requires O(n).   

#### Topological ordering
Let G = (V, E) be a directed graph. A topological ordering of G is an assignment $` f(v) `$ of every vertex $` v \in V `$ to a different number such that: for every $` (v, w) \in E `$, $` f(v) < f(w) `$.   

### Quiz 8.3

#### Directed Acyclic Graph
A directed acyclic graph (DAG) denotes a directed graph without any directed circles.   

A source vertex of a directed graph is a vertex with no incoming edges (a sink vertex is a vertex without outgoing edges).   

#### Theorem 8.6
Every directed acyclic graph has at least one topological ordering.   
Proof:   
Use Lemma 8.7 for proof. Since the given graph is a directed acyclic graph, it has at least one source vertex. Choose a source vertex $` v_1 `$ in G. Get G' from G by excluding $` v_1 `$ and all of its edges. Since removing a vertex does not add cycles, G' is also a directed acyclic graph. Repeat this process recursively: find a source in G', remove it, and so on. The only edges in G that are not also in G' are (outgoing) edges of $` v_1 `$. As a source vertex, $` v_1 `$ has no incoming edge, which leads to traveling forward in ordering. 

#### Lemma 8.7
Every directed acyclic graph has at least one source vertex.   
Proof:   
Choose a vertex in V of G = (V, E). If this vertex has no incoming edge, it is a source vertex. Continue iterating n times where |V| = n if not faced with a vertex without incoming edge, so that the found edges are $` (v_n, v_{n-1}), ..., (v_1, v_0) `$. Since there are exactly n number of vertices there exists a repeat in the sequence $` v_n, v_{n-1}, ..., v_0 `$, which contradicts definition of a directed acyclic graph.

Notice that f-value setting and decrement of curLabel happen together.
```

#### Theorem 8.8
For every directed acyclic graph G = (V, E) in adjacency-list representation:   
(a) At the conclusion of TopoSort, every vertex $` v `$ has been assigned an f-value, and these f-values constitute a topological ordering of G.   
(b) The running time of TopoSort is O(m + n), where m = |E| and n = |V|.   
Proof:   
For part (b) each vertex is explored only once, and therefore a constant number of operations are performed on each vertex or edge. For part (a), i.e. for correctness, note that DFS-Topo assigns $` f(v) `$ and decrements `curLabel` value at its completion. This guarantees unique $` f(v) `$ values. Now, it is to be shown that for every edge $` (v, w) \in E `$, it holds that $` f(v) < f(w) `$. There are two cases in one of which $` v `$ is discovered before $` w `$ and in the other which $` w `$ is discoverd earlier. For the first case, DFS-Topo is called on $` v `$ recursively calling DFS-Top on $` w `$ before completing. Because DFS-Topo on $` w `$ completes before DFS-Topo on $` v `$, $` f(v) < f(w) `$. For the second case, DFS-Topo on $` w `$ completes without traversing back to $` v `$ because G is a directed acyclic graph. Hence DFS-Topo on $` v `$ is runs after DFS-Topo on $` w `$ has completed, and again $` f(v) < f(w) `$.   

#### Strongly Connected Component
A strongly connected component (SCC) of a directed is a maximal subset $` S ⊆ V `$ such that there is a directed path from any vertex in S to any other vertex in S.   

Between SCCs, if each is converted into a single vertex, they are directed acyclic graph.   

#### Proposition 8.9
Let G = (V, E) be a directed graph. Define the corresponding meta-graph H = (X, F) with one meta-vertex $` x \in X `$ per SCC of G and a meta-edge $` (x, y) `$ in F whenever there is an edge in G from a vertex in the SCC corresponding to $` x `$ to one in the SCC corresponding to $` y `$. Then H is a directed acyclic graph.   
```text
More intuitively, 
SCC1 consisting of v1, v2 and v3 is abstracted to be x. 
SCC2 consisting of w1, w2 and w3 is abstracted to be y.
```
Proof:   
We prove by contradiction. Assume that H has a directed cycle with $` k \geq 2 `$ vertices. This means there are distinct SCCs, $` S_1, S_2, ..., S_k `$. Now, because there is a cycle in H, there is a sequence of SCCs such that there is a path from $` S_1 `$ to $` S_2 `$, from $` S_2 `$ to $` S_3 `$, and so on, eventually returning back to $` S_1 `$. That is, in the original graph G, there exists a path from any vertex in $` S_1 `$ to some vertex in $` S_2 `$, then to $` S_3 `$, ..., and finally back to $` S_1 `$. This implies a single SCC, not $` k `$ number of SCCs.   

### Quiz 8.5
Consider a directed acyclic graph G = (V, E) with |V| = n and |E| = m. What are the minimum and maximum number of strongly connected components that the graph could have, respectively?   
n and n   
```text
Unlike Proposition 8.9, it is not a directed graph but a directed acyclic one. 
```

#### Theorem 8.10
Let G be a directed graph, with the vertices ordered arbitrarily, and for each vertex $` v \in V `$ let $` f(v) `$ denote the position of $` v `$ computed by the TopoSort algorithm. Let $` S_1, S_2 `$ denote two SCCs of G, and suppose G has an edge $` (v, w) `$ with $` v \in S_1 `$ and $` w \in S_2 `$. Then, 
```math
\begin{align}
\min_{x \in S_1} f(x) < \min_{y \in S_2} f(y)
\end{align}
```
Proof:   
Suppose two cases. First, assume that vertices in $` S_1 `$ are discovered before those of $` S_2 `$. Since there is an edge $` (v, w) `$ from $` S_1 `$ to $` S_2 `$, the TopoSort traversal starting from $` v \in S_1 `$ will eventually explore $` w \in S_2 `$. This causes the TopoSort algorithm to traverse all of $` S_2 `$ before finishing $` S_1 `$. Thus, all vertices in $` S_2 `$ receive f-values before any vertex in $` S_1 `$. Since the TopoSort algorithm assigns f-values in decreasing order, $` S_1 `$ ends up with smaller f-values than $` S_2 `$. For the last case, suppose that vertices in $` S_2 `$ are discovered before $` S_1 `$. Because G is a directed graph and $` S_1, S_2 `$ are distinct SCCs, and because there is an edge from $` S_1 `$ to $` S_2 `$, there cannot be a path from any vertex in $` S_2 `$ to any vertex in $` S_1 `$. Otherwise, they would belong to the same SCC. Thus, the TopoSort started in $` S_2 `$ cannot reach $` S_1 `$. The TopoSort algorithm assigns f-values to all vertices in $` S_2 `$ and completes. Then, it eventually starts on $` S_1 `$. Since the `curLabel` is decreasing, vertices in $` S_1 `$ receive smaller f-values than those in $` S_2 `$.   

#### Corollary 8.11
Let $` G `$ be a directed graph, with the vertices ordered arbitrarily, and for each vertex $` v \in V `$ let $` f(v) `$ denote the position of $` v `$ computed by the TopoSort algorithm on the reversed graph $` G^{rev} `$. Let $` S_1, S_2 `$ be two SCCs of $` G `$, and suppose $` G `$ has an edge $` (v, w) `$ with $` v \in S_1 `$ and $` w \in S_2 `$. Then,
```math
\begin{align}
\min_{x \in S_1} f(x) > \min_{y \in S_2} f(y)
\end{align}
```

G has directed cycle -> no topological ordering.    
every directed acyclic graph has a sink vertex.   

### Quiz 8.6
Let $` G `$ be a directed graph and $` G^{rev} `$ a copy of $` G `$ with the direction of every edge reversed. How are the SCCs of $` G `$ and $` G^{rev} `$ related?
- Every source SCC of $` G `$ is also a source SCC of $` G^{rev} `$.
- Every sink SCC of $` G `$ becomes a source SCC of $` G^{rev} `$.

G:
               1  ←  2  →  4  →  5
                ↘   ↗       ↖   ↙ 
                  3           6
reversed G:
               1  →  2  ←  4  ←  5
                ↖   ↙       ↘   ↗ 
                  3           6
One topological ordering is: f(1) = 4, f(2) = 5, f(3) = 6, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 2.

Applying this to G results in below.
G with (f-value):
               1(4) ←  2(5)  →  4(1) →  5(3)
                  ↘   ↗            ↖   ↙ 
                   3(6)             6(2)
vertex 4 is a sink.


G with (SCC number):
               1(2) ←  2(2) →  4(1) → 5(1)
                 ↘    ↗          ↖    ↙ 
                  3(2)            6(1)
In increasing order of f-values, execute the DFS-SCC algorithm and each loop assign the same SCC-value.
```

#### Theorem 8.12
For every directed graph G = (V, E) in adjacency-list representations:   
(a) At the conclusion of Kosaraju, for every pair $` v,w `$ of vertices, $` scc(v) = scc(w) `$ if and only if $` v `$ and $` w `$ belong to the same strongly connected component of G.   
(b) The running time of Kosaraju is O(m + n), where m = |E| and n = |V|.   
Proof:   
For part (b), since DFS is performed twice, the running time is O(m + n). For part (a), consider a vertex $` v `$ in SCC $` S_1 `$ as a starting vertex of a DFS-SCC call. By Corollary 8.11, for any edge from $` v `$ to a different SCC $` S_2 `$, there must be at least one vertex in $` S_2 `$ with a smaller f-value than $` f(v) `$. Since DFS-SCC is called in increasing order of f-values, $` S_2 `$ has already been explored by the time $` v `$ is processed. This means DFS-SCC initiated from $` v `$ remains within $` S_1 `$. Also, by the definition of SCC and DFS, the subroutine explores every vertex in the current SCC, resulting in assigning the same SCCNumber to all the vertices of the current SCC.   

### Problem 8.5
Let G be a directed graph but not acyclic. The TopoSort algorithm does not compute a topological ordering of G since none exists. Does it compute an ordering that minimizes the number of edges that travel backward?   
Not always but sometimes yes.   

### Problem 8.6
Given a directed graph G, if you add one new edge, whwat would happen to the number of SCCS?   
...might or might not remain the same (depending on G and the new edge). Also, cannot increase.   

### Problem 8.7
Kosaraju has two DFS subroutines. First to calculate f-values on the reversed graph, and second to get SCCs. Is BFS applicable as a replacement?   
Only for the second DFS subroutine, the BFS algorithm could be used instead of DFS.   

### Problem 8.8
Kosaraju has two passes of DFS. Below are all true.
- (a) if f-values are computed in increasing order in the first pass, and in the second pass verteices are considered in decreasing order, the Kosaraju algorithm remains correct.
- (b) Using the original graph in the first pass and the reversed graph in the second pass, the Kosaraju algorithm remains correct.

### Problem 8.9
There are a set of clauses, each of which is the disjunction (logical "or") of two literals. (A literal is a Boolean variable or the negation of a Boolean variable.) A value of "true" or "false" is to be assigned to variables so that all the clauses are satisfied. For example, if the input contains the three clauses X1 ∨ X2, ¬X1 ∨ X3, and ¬X2 ∨ ¬X3, then one way to satisfy all of them is to set X1 and X3 to "true" and X2 to "false." Design an algorithm that determines whether or not a given 2SAT instance has at least one satisfying assignment with the running time of O(m + n) time, where m and n are the number of clauses and variables, respectively.   
-> It is important to figure out for each variable there possibly exist two literals which should be vertices of a directed graph.   

## week 2 - Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm
Dijkstra is for single-source shortest path problems.   

Here, Dijkstra's algorithm is applied on a directed graph but with slight modifications it also solves undirected graph's shortest path problem. BFS is an alternative to Dijiktra only if all lengths are 1. BFS could still work by spliting lengths into 1 but only if the number is not big, since big lengths cause increase the running time of O(m + n).      

The key smart idea of Dijkstra's algorithm is the way how to choose the next vertex.   

```text
        v                (s, v): 1
     ↗  |  ↘             (v, t): 6
   s    |    t           (v, w): 2
     ↘  ↓  ↗             (s, w): 4
        w                (w, t): 3

0. Initialize: len(s) = 0

1.
+---------+           +-------------+
|   X     |           |    V - X    |
|---------|           |-------------|   
|     ──────────────────▶ v         |   len(s) + l_sv = 0 + 1 = 1 → vertex v is chosen and set len(v) = 1
|   s     |           |             |
|     ──────────────────▶ w         |   len(s) + l_sw = 0 + 4 = 4
+---------+           +-------------+
It is one and only one vertex added to X at each loop.

2.
+---------+           +-------------+
|   X     |           |    V - X    |
|---------|           |-------------|
|   s ──────────────────▶           |   len(s) + l_sw = 0 + 4 = 4
|         |           |   w         |
|     ──────────────────▶           |   len(v) + l_vw = 1 + 2 = 3 → vertex w is chosen and set len(w) = 3
|   v     |           |             |
|     ──────────────────▶ t         |   len(v) + l_vt = 1 + 6 = 7   
+---------+           +-------------+

and so on...
```

#### Theorem 9.1
For every directed graph G = (V, E), every starting vertex $` s `$, and every choice of nonnegative edge lengths, at the conclusion of Dijkstra, $` len(v) = dist(s, v) `$ for every vertex $` v \in V `$.   
Proof:   
We use mathematical induction. Let P(k) be a statement of "for the k-th vertex $` v `$ added to the set X in Dijkstra $` len(v) = dist(s, v) `$". The base case holds since a starting vertex s is with $` dist(s, s) = len(s) = 0 `$. As part of induction process, assume P(k-1) holds with the k-1 vertex $` v^* `$ added to the set X. Now for the k vertex $` w^* `$ added to the set X and let $` (v^*, w^*) `$ be the chosen edge in the corresponding iteration, $` len(w^*) = dist(s, w^*) `$ to be shown. Since there is an edge $` (v^*, w^*) `$, there is a path $` P^* `$ from $` s `$ to $` w^* `$ which is through $` s `$ to $` v^* `$ and then finally to $` w^* `$. This path has a length $` len(w^*) `$ and by the definition of $` dist(s, w^*) `$, which is the shortest path between $` s `$ and $` w^* `$,
```math
dist(s, w^*) \leq len(w^*)
```
Now, let $` P' `$ be a some path travels from $` s `$ to $` w^* `$ of $` s `$ to $` y `$ and then from $` y `$ to $` z `$ and to $` w^* `$ with $` y \in X `$ and $` z \in V-X `$. The three parts of the travel are:
- $` s `$ to $` y `$'s length $` \geq dist(s, y) = len(y)`$
- $` y `$ to $` z `$'s length $` = l_{yz} `$
- $` z `$ to $` w^* `$''s length is unknown but nonnegative.
```math
\begin{align}
\text{The length of } P' \geq len(y) + l_{yz} + 0 \\
= \text{Dijkstra score of } z \\
\geq len(v^*) + l_{v^*w^*} \\
\end{align}
```
The last ineqaulity holds since at the corresponding iteration of Dijkstra, the edge $` (v^*, w^*) `$ is chosen over $` (y, z) `$.   

#### Proposition 9.2
For every directed graph G = (V, E), every starting vertex s, and every choice of nonnegative edge lengths, the straightforward implementation of Dijkstra runs in O(mn) time, where m = |E| and n = |V|.   

Without Heap, Dijkstra's running time is $` \Theta(mn) `$. But if the heap data structure is used, it is $` O(m\log n) `$    

### Problem 9.1
Consider a directed graph with distinct and nonnegative edge lengths and a source vertex s. Fix a destination vertex t, and assume that the graph contains at least one s-t path. Which of the following statements are true? [Check all that apply.]   
(Wrong) The shortest s-t path must include the minumum length edge of G.   

### Problem 9.5
Consider a directed graph G and a source vertex s. Suppose G has some negative edge lengths but no negative cycles, meaning G does not have a directed cycle in which the sum of the edge lengths is negative. Suppose you run Dijkstra's algorithm on G (with source s). Which of the following statements are true? [Check all that apply.]   
Dijkstra's algorithm always terminates, and in some cases the paths it computes will be the correct shortest paths from s to all other vertices.
